Based on the code by Emilie Gillet (Mutable Instruments), Andrew Belt (VCV) and other contributors. Macro Oscillator 2 GUI and parameter handling was updated by Github user anlexmatos. There is also a version of Random Sampler (based on Marbles) that has dedicated GUI knobs for controlling the output gate lengths and their randomization.

Note, June 12th 2020 : You probably shouldn't build binaries from the current git repo master branch. I made a mistake and didn't put various experimental, in-work, things into a new git branch. Nobody will probably ever read this, but oh well...I will very likely revert this git master branch to an earlier state very soon.

# Poly_AudibleInstruments

Plugin for VCV Rack.

Currently has experimental polyphonic versions of the Macro Oscillator 1 and 2 modules. (Based on Braids and Plaits). 
Based on the code by Emilie Gillet (Mutable Instruments), Andrew Belt (VCV) and other contributors. Macro Oscillator 2 GUI and parameter handling was updated by Github user anlexmatos. 

The plugin also has a version of Random Sampler (based on Marbles) included that has dedicated GUI knobs for controlling the output gate lengths and their randomization. No polyphony support has yet been added to that module. That might happen in the future.
